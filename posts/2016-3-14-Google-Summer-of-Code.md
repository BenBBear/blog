# Introduction



- Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that matches students up with open source, free software and technology-related organizations to write code and get paid to do it! 



- From over 100 countries worldwide. As of January 2016, over 515 open source projects



- 12 week


- Do you have some programming experience at the university level? Then, yes, you are good enough! 





# Applying



## 了解相关 Open Source Organization

- Join and read mailing List
- Join the IRC Channel
- Introduce yourself, 表明 you want to contribute
- Read available information about past GSoc Project
- Read through the project documentation, and ask questions in detail

## Choose Organization

- what open source software you use
- professional interest
- hobby
- skill
- what you want from gsoc

## Find the Project



Consider any questions you might have about the project, how it might be implemented, and what it would entail. Read the FAQs. If there's still anything unclear about the project and requirements, get your doubts cleared.



You may even consider preparing mock-ups (illustrations, powerpoint, or web sites) to help clarify your understanding and vision of the project.



From project idea to plan



**Pro Tip:** *The earlier you apply, the better. Submitting your proposal early helps you get early feedback.*



**Warning:** Cut and pasting an idea from the organization page and turning that in as your project's description is a no-no. You'll be expected to research and submit your own ideas about how to accomplish the project your way, not just state the end result.

### 失败原因





**Projects without a mentor**    

Try to make sure that someone in the organization would be competent to work with you.

---

**Projects that better belong with other Summer of Code organization**   


Open source organizations try hard to avoid stepping on each other's turf. Try to find your best customer.

---

**Projects that represent too large a scope**

Detail Plan

---

**Incoherent proposals**



**Stuff that’s already been done to death**



## 看后感受

- 把Idea Proposal写好，着重experience，和第一人称GPS如何展示，倾向于graphics，vr，cs方面。

- 选Organization

- 联系mentor，要在open source organization中先participate（这个没有提前做好准备，要现在开始，另外还需要在facebook, twitter下和mentor联系，交流idea，时间很紧张）


- 提交越早越好
